# Stream Deck plugin for CameraDeck

This is the companion Stream Deck plugin for the Camera Deck application. CameraDeck is a MacOS app that allows you to control your camera (currently only Sony cameras are supported) from your desktop.

This plugin adds Stream Deck buttons for easier access to the CameraDeck functionality.

## Installation

Download the com.camaradeck.streamDeckPlugin file from the `dist` directory. Open the file on your machine, and it should be installed by the Stream Deck application.

## Future Improvements

Future releases of this plugin will use the github release feature. This will allow a simple one click download from the releases tab. This plugin will also be added to the Elgato Stream Deck store for easy installation.
